# dom-w-Chat-GPT2
I wanted to understand the DOM and how to use it, so I went to Chat-GPT. I've added comments to each line of code of the JavaScript file. Here are my prompts:

Prompt 1:

Create a mini course that twill teach me all about the DOM using JavaScript. Give me problems to solve and put comments over each line of code that briefly explain what is happening.

Prompt 2:

Explain what to do for each step of the instructions and why.


Prompt 3:
Along with the explanations that you've provided, also include the syntax for each step

Prompt 4:
The explanation should be explained with thorough text and the syntax for each step should be shown as code.

Prompt 5:
Include the syntax for each line of code in a comment using //

Prompt 6:
You forgot to include explanations for each step and why 

Prompt 7:
Now help me with the syntax of each line. Ask me to select a div element from HTML that you create.

Prompt 8:
Make it a test format where I give my answer and you check it at each step

// After all of these prompts, I was able to get Chat-GPT to structure the mini course how I wanted it to be (minus the syntax that I asked for (not sure why), so I just looked up the syntax on w3schools.com.

// Now I have a much better understanding of the DOM.
